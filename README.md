# Cherry Leaves ML Project

## Business Requirements

       The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

       To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

       - 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
       - 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

       To identify the mildew leaves.
       The primary goal for this project is to distinguish the difference between a healthy leaves and a mildew one. Data visualization can help understand the pattern in understanding the visual patterns and features associated with healthy and diseased leaves.

       To be able to improve efficiency
       Machine learning can help in automating the identification process, reducing the time and resources required for manual inspections.

       To be able to use in different crop disease detection
       This Machine learning might also be a help in detecting diseases or pests that is affecting the cherry trees. 


##  The Hypothesis and How to validate?

       - Hypothesis:
       By creating a  machine learning algorithms, it is possible to develop a model capable of accurately distinguishing between healthy cherry leaves and leaves affected by powdery mildew based on distinct visual features. It is believe  that  with these characteristics value such as color, texture, and patterns it will be able to discern the differences between healthy and infected leaves, enabling the ML to classify images with high accuracy.

       Validation:
       To validate our hypothesis, we will undertake the following steps:

       1. Data Collection: Collect different dataset consisting of images for both healthy cherry leaves and leaves affected with powdery mildew. This is to ensure that the dataset encompasses various stages of infection and environmental conditions to enhance the accuracy of the model.

       2. Data Preprocessing: Process the collected images to standardize their format, resolution, and orientation. Additionally, perform preprocessing techniques such as augmentation to enhance the model's ability to generalize across different samples. The images provided in the test are in different sizes, resolutions and orientations to make sure that the ML machine can practice reading the images in all forms. 

       3. Model Development: Design the model to learn discriminative features from the input images and make accurate predictions regarding leaf health status.

       4. Training and Validation:  Train the model on the training data while looking at the  performance on the validation set. Adjust hyperparameters and network architecture as necessary to optimize model performance. The ratio are the following: 
                     Training Set: 70% of the total data
                     Validation Set: 10% of the total data
                     Test Set: 20% of the total data

       5. Evaluation: Assess the trained model's performance using the reserved testing set. Measure key metrics such as accuracy, and F1-score to quantify the model's ability to correctly classify healthy and infected leaves.


       By  following these steps, we aim to validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the accuracy of using machine learning algorithms for  detection of powdery mildew in cherry leaves in a fast way.

## ML Business Case

       To be able to implement a machine learning solution that utilizes image classification techniques to differentiate between healthy cherry leaves and those infected with powdery mildew. The solution will involve the following steps:

       1. Data Collection. Gather a diverse dataset collection between healthy leaves and powdery mildew leaves of the Cherry Trees. It should be from different angle, lighting conditions and of differenct stages of the disease, powdery mildew.

       2. Data Processing. We process the dataset by cleaning and preprocessing it. We also try to enhance the quality of the images and the consistency of the dataset. This might involve augmentation and resizing techniques to improve the quality of the dataset. 

       3. Model Development. Train the machine learning model, such as CNN ( Convulutional Nueral Network), on the proprocessed data. This is so that it optimize the model architecture and hyperparameters to maximize accuracy and minimize overfitting.

       4. Model Evaluation. validate the train model using datasets to assess its performance in accurately classifying cherry leaves as healthy or infected. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be used to evaluate model performance. It needs to pass the criteria of 97% accuracy.

       5. Deployment. Create a web interface to interate the trained machine learning model for capturing and analyzing the leaf images. This platform should be a user friendly and easily accessible to the workers in the field.

## Expected Outcome
       1. Accuracy Enhancement. The machine learning model is expected to have a high accuracy level in determining if the leaves have mildew or not.

       2. Efficiency Improvement. By doing automation in detecting the disease it saves time in inspecting every tree on the field all the time. The model should be able to shorten the time in inspecting the cherry leaves.

       4. Cost Saving. The business will be able to save time and labor with this model. 

## Dataset Content

       - The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
       - The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Unfixed Bugs

       1.I tried to create another machine learning for the ML app wherein the ML app can also detect if the image is a leaf or not. Tested the ML machine with a logo of facebook and it has detected an error in its reading. However it has not said that it is either a leaf or an inanimate object.
       
       2.Deploying the ML app to heroku. For days I have been trying to deploy my ML app in Heroku and it seems to sometimes work sometimes not. I have fixed this bug and hopefully the app will now run smoothly
       
       3.For Some reason when I run my ML app locally everything works fine but if I run my app in Heroku. Heroku has decided that SavedModel file does not exist at: jupyter_notebooks/outputs/v1/cherry_leaves_model.keras/{saved_model.pbtxt|saved_model.pb}. This bug has also been fixed and is now running smoothly in both heroku and locally.

       4. I have encountered Error R14(memory quota exceed). I seems that my memory qouta for this app is about to exceed its limit. However, the website is still functioning properly. I need to to create a monitor performance or upgrade my heroku dyno. For now I will not change anything unless during testing the website would crash.
